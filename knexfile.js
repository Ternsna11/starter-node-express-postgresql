// require("dotenv").config(); requires and loads dotenv into the application code. Dotenv loads the environment variables that you defined in .env (which currently only contains DATABASE_URL) into process.env.

// const { DATABASE_URL } = process.env; stores the value of process.env.DATABASE_URL in a variable called DATABASE_URL.

// connection: DATABASE_URL, sets the location of the database for the development environment to DATABASE_URL (which is currently the URL for your ElephantSQL database instance).

// Setting directory: path.join(__dirname, "src", "db", "migrations") within the migrations object will tell Knex to store migration files in the migrations folder at src/db/migrations
